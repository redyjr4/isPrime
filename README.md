# isPrime
A prime number library I created for C.
An integer function that takes a positive (> 0) integer as an argument, and returns a value of 1 or 0 corresponding with whether the number is prime or not.

Function Format:
*int* **isPrime** (*unsigned long long int* **number**)

for *number* > 0, value returned is 1 if *number* is prime, 0 if *number* is __not__ prime.
